Building/Installing the Rose Compiler on Debian 8.1 (Jessie)
============================================================

This guide will walk you through the installation of the Rose compiler
framework on a fresh installation of Debian 8.1.0 (amd64).

Setting up the build environment:
=================================

Install the following packages:

	build-essential gcc-4.8 g++-4.8 flex bison libarchive-dev gcc-multilib
	g++-multilib git gfortran libbz2-dev curl libpython-dev openjdk-7-jdk
	zlib1g-dev automake autoconf libtool

Make sure gcc-4.8 is the default compiler:

     sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/gcc gcc /usr/bin/gcc-4.8 50
     sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/g++ g++ /usr/bin/g++-4.8 100


You can check if it worked by executing gcc and g++ with the '-v'
flag.

Install the Boost libraries:
============================

Debian stable comes with boost 1.55, but Rose requires a version of
boost smaller than 1.54, e.g., boost 1.53.

http://www.boost.org/users/history/version_153_0.html

In your home directory:

   mkdir programs
   cd programs
   ... download boost_1_53_0.tar.gz ...
   tar xfz boost_1_53_0.tar.gz
   cd boost_1_53_0
   mkdir installTree
   ./bootstrap.sh --prefix=installTree
   ./bjam --prefix=installTree

Note: if you have multiple cores, you can add a '-j$N' to the
invocation of bjam, where $N$ is the number of parallel compiler
processes you would like to run.

If all goes well, install boost into 'installTree':

      ./bjam --prefix=installTree install

Make sure that installTree lib now contains the libraries
'libboost_iostreams', 'libbooost_date_time', and 'libboost-thread'.


Now, make sure the boost libraries as well as libjvm.so is visible to
the linker, for example, by adding the following to your .bashrc and
opening a new terminal:

	export BOOST_DIR=~/programs/boost_1_53_0/installTree
	export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$BOOST_DIR/lib:/usr/lib/jvm/java-7-openjdk-amd64/jre/lib/amd64/server"


Installation of Rose:
=====================

Begin by cloning the rose git repository. In your home dir:

      cd programs
      git clone https://github.com/rose-compiler/rose

This cane take a while.

     cd rose
     ./build
     mkdir compileTree
     cd compileTree
     ../configure --with-boost-libdir=$BOOST_DIR/lib --with-boost=$BOOST_DIR
     make
     make install
